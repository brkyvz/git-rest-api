This means two things.  First, the design matrix is rank deficient, in that the same column space can be represented by one fewer columns.  I suppose there were some numerical methods for solving for the parameters $B$ that needed full-rank matrices, but if there are still such methods that are widely used, I don't know what they are.  I believe the most common method for estimation is to use the pseudoinverse, that does not require full-rank matrices.\n\nIf there are very many factors, say $M$ factors, and we just model the main effects, and we always use indicator coding, then there will be $M-1$ redundant columns in the design, and this could slow down estimation and increase memory use, but I guess the case of $M$ being large enough to cause a problem is rather rare."],"language":"python","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"prompt_number":187},{"cell_type":"markdown","collapsed":false,"source":["#### The statistical argument"],"language":"python","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"prompt_number":188},{"cell_type":"markdown","collapsed":false,"source":["In part we have heard this argument already.  The formula is a kind of shorthand for an hierarchical ANOVA model, seen in the model fit summary, but most clearly in the `anova` table.  The intention is to make the parameters from the fit meaningful in terms of hypotheses that R assumes you intended in the arrangement of terms in your formula.  The contrast coding rules make these $B$ coefficients more useful for this purpose.\n\nThe problem with indicator coding is that the coefficients from the estimation are often not useful without further testing.  For two factors with indicator coding, there is an immediate problem with interpreting the $B$ coefficients; they are not uniquely estimable.  Let's say we do a fit of the design $X$ to the data $Y$, giving us a parameter vector $B$.  Remember that the indicator columns for the first factor will sum to a column of ones, and so will the indicator columns for the second factor. This means that we can add a constant $S$ to the beta coefficients for all levels of the first factor, subtract $S$ from all the betas for the levels of the second factor, and still get the same $\\hat{Y}$.

Similarly we have indicator coding for `awesome` in the interaction, giving indicator coding for the interaction overall, and a rank deficient design.
